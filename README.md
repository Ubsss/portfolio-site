### Purpose

Why did I take the time to design, build and host a portfolio site you ask? **Great question!** The simple answer is passion. I ‚ù§Ô∏ècoding! This site began as a little project to further my web development skills. I then decided to turn it into a fully-functional application and host it publicly. üòÖ It was not the easiest thing but I learned a ton!

### Tools Used

Now you ask how did I build this site? **Another great question!** To prevent a long essay, I will simply list the tools and frameworks I used.

| Tool      | Description                                           | Reason for use                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| React.js  | For building reusable user interface components       | It is amazing for creating simple, contained code! Thank you Facebook.                                                             |
| Bootstrap | CSS library                                           | I used a variation for react called React-Bootstrap due to it not needing JQuery! Can't have two JS libraries fighting each other. |
| Redux.js  | Centralized state management                          | React is state heavy and redux makes it easy to manage state. I can't believe I use to make react apps without redux!              |
| Firebase  | Free platform for web apps                            | This is where my backend lives. Specifically the functions and hosting services. Thank you Google.                                 |
| Travis CI | Continuous integration & continuous delivery platform | Automated testing and deployment are fundamental to reduce overhead. And it is totally cool!                                       |
| GitHub    | Version control                                       | I don't think I really need to get into this one, you are here after all.                                                          |

Those are some of the major tools I used. Check out my [package.json](./package.json) for a more detailed dependencies list.

### Lessons Learned

**Oh boy**, this list could go on forever! üòÇBut here are the major ones.

- Learning takes time. Never rush the process and rob yourself.
- CSS is the foundation of great user experience.
- There are a million ways to implement functionality! Pick one, make it and iterate. Simple.
- Take breaks, it helps the creative juices flow.
- A small team does not need much overhead.
- Eliminate redundancy! In code, process or functionality.
- Read documentation! It saves a lot of time and headaches.
- JavaScript is amazing!
- Have fun!!! No of it is work the time and energy if you do not enjoy doing it.
